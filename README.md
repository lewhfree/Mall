# Mall - A FALL.EXE Decomp
Daggerfall FALL.exe Decomp

To run daggerfall, you must:

```
Z:> mount c <parent directory of DAGGER folder, not actually the DAGGER folder>
Z:> c:
C:> cd DAGGER
C:\DAGGER> FALL.EXE Z.CFG.
```

FALL is the main program, and so that is why I am targeting it, and not DAGGER.EXE.
