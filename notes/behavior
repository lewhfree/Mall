1000:0000 - CLI			- Turns off hardware interupts
1000:0001 - PUSH SS		- Puts the "stack pointer" on the stack
1000:0002 - POP DS		- Sets the "data section pointer" to the "stack pointer" and pop it off the stack
				- SS and DS are now pointing to the same thing
1000:0003 - MOV AX,ES:[0x2]	- Sets ax to ES:0x2 - This is weird because ES doesn't start initialized in dos exes. Coms do but not exes
				- Presumably, DAGGER.EXE is setting this. IDK though.
1000:0007 - SUB AX,0x40		- Sets AX to AX - 0x40. Sets AX to (ES:0002) - 0x40
